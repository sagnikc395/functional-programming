## What is the main idea behind functional programming ?

- Functions are in the center of our designs.
- Functions act as both algorithms and data.
- Solving problems only be composition -> combining.

- Functional Programming is languages agnostic , it can be designed in any language that uses function as a first class citizen i.e function as values.

- Functional Programming is declaartive (vs imperative), think of functional programming as a chain of transformations over input.

- By limiting the power , we get more control and discipline. Loops are not present and instead we use loops.

- Bad designs produce unexpected consequences whereas good designs produced unexpected benefits.

### Why Functional Programming ?

- Less time needed to reason about the code.
- Less boilerplate code.
- Less time required to write tests meaning more confidence.
- More reusuable code. -> less mutation of values, values are immutable and functions are predictable.
- More beauty in code and design.
