### History of OCaml:

- OCaml comes from the line of programming language whose grandfather is Lisp and inclues other programming languages like Clojure, Haskell,Racket etc.

- OCaml coes from the work done by Robin milnet and others in theorm proving in 70s and 80s.

- He was running into problems of incorrect proofs that were claiming to be valid-> he developed a language that only allowed us to construct valid proofs. ML which stands for meta language -> result of that work.

- Type system for ML was carefully constructed so that we could only construct valid proofs in this language.

- in the 90s, ML fragmented in OCaml and Standard ML.
