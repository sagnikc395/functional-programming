## Functions

### Function Definitions

- let x = 42 ;  has an expression in it but is not itself an expression.
- It is rather a definition.
- Definitions bind values to names, in this case, the value 42 being bound to name x.

- non recursive function definitions:
  let f x  = ...

- recrusive function definitions:
  let rec f x = ...
