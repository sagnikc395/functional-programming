## ocaml-fun

learning ocaml to go into the depths of functional programming.

### About Functional Programming:

- Functional programming provides a different perspective on programming than what we have experienced in out daily coding life.
- It would require us to let go of old ideas: assignemnt statements, loops, classes and objects.

- Common features of Functional Programming that will be learned through OCaml:

  - Experience the freedom of immutability.
  - Improve at abstraction -> practice of avoiding repetition by factoring out commonality.
  - Will be exposed to a type system that at first we will hate , since it will reject programs we think are correct. Later we will realise that we love it, because we humbly realize it was right and our programs were wrong.
  - We will be exposed to some of the theory and implementation of programming languages, helping us to understand the foundations of what we are saying to the computer when we write code.
