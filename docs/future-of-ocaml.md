## Future of OCaml

- Programming is a fast-changing field that we need to be able to rapidly adapt. A good programmer has to learn the principles behind programming that transcend the specifics of any specific language.

- OCaml does a great job of clarifying and simplifying the essence of functional programming in a way that other languages that blend functional and imperative programming (like Scala) or take functional programming to extreme(like Haskell) do not.

- Java bought GC into mainstream in 1995, Lisp had it in 1958. Java had generics in 2004, ML had it in 1990. Lamdbas and functional programming concepts came in Java in Java8+ , functional programming langs had them long before.
